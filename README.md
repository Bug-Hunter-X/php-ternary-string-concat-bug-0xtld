This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP involving the ternary operator (? :) during string concatenation. When the ternary operator's result is null or undefined, PHP's type coercion may result in unexpected outputs. The bug.php file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.php provides a corrected version using explicit type checking.  The issue is further explained in the detailed comments within the code.
